Idea of this app is to find the cheapest tickets for the itinerary you have mentioned in your Google sheets (where you have to mention City, IATACode, Lowest Price).
Kiwi is used as a platform to find the tickets.
Twilio is used to send notifications to you mobile phone number about cheap prices.
Smtplib is used to send e-mail notifications for cheap prices.
